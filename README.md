#There was a little girl who had a timer that showed the amount of time she had to lie. She had created a list of all the things she wanted to do in the world before she was gone. She had taken months and almost a year to create the list. She was so focused on the list that she had only two years to do the list. By spending so much time planning out everything in life gave her little time to live her life.
